### NotFound
# let's see how to do not found route

// first create NotFoud.vue
// then create route for NotFound page

$const routes = [
   { 
     path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*',
     name: 'NotFound',
     component: NotFound
   },
];


### Go Back

<button @click="$router.back()">Go Back </button>


### router push
# if we type like "products/121212" which does not exist id of the product, NotFound action will not work, to work this, we have to do like the following

import { useRouter } from 'vue-router'

const router = useRouter()

onMounted(async () => {
    const result = await fetch(`api/products/${route.params.id}`)
    if(result.status === 404) {
      router.push({ name: 'Notfound' })
    }
    const response = await result.json()
    product.value = response
})
