### we use "ref()" and "reactive()" for reactivity
# let's have a look at plain variable without "ref()" and "reactive()"

# template
<div> {{ name }} </div> // template will show "Ye Myint Soe" not "Lin Khant Ko"

# js
export default {
  setup(){
    let name = 'Ye Myint Soe'
    setTimeOut(() => {
      name = 'Lin Khant Ko'
      console.log(name) // console will show "Lin Khant Ko" not "Ye Myint Soe"
    },2000)
    return {
      name
    }
  }
}

# as we see, if we don't use "ref()" or "reactive()", variable can not be changed
